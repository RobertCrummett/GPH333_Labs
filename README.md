# GPH 333 Lab Submissions

Hello world!
These are my submissions to Corn√© Kreemer's GPH 333 Lab Section. 
I scored very well in the class, however, there are a handful of errors in these scripts. I am not interested in correcting these errors.
This repo is serving as a backup to my flashdrive full of school stuff, in the unfortunate case it fails on me.
