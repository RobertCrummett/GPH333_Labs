# GPH 333 Lab Submissions

Hello world!
There are my submissions to Corn√© Kreemer's GPH 333 Lab of 2022.
I scored very well in the class, however, there are a handful of errors in these labs. I am not interested in correcting these errors.
This repo is serving as a backup to my flashdrive full of school stuff, incase it fails one day.
